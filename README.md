# BubFusion

The game consists of levels. The level is a grid field which can consists moving and stationary objects. There can initially be two types of balls on the level: full and empty. With the help of swipes, the player is able to move the balls. When touch begin, the same balls combine into one, which changes the type. For example, two full ones make an empty one and opposite. In addition to the balls, various obstacles will be placed on the level, such as spikes, walls, etc.
The player's task is to fuse all the balls into one.
